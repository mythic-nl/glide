# Glide
Glide is a fast-paced movement game inspired by classic Source Engine surfing and bunny hopping mechanics. Built around fluid motion and skillful traversal, it transforms these beloved mechanics into a full standalone experience.

### Technical details
Unity version: v6000.2.3f1

### How to work
* **main** is our production branch, only push working bug-free code there.
* **develop** is all our code that still needs to go through quality assurance.
* When developing create your own branch from **develop**.
* New branches must categorized in the following sections: **feature/**, **bug/**, **refactor/**
* An example would be: **feature/source-character-controller**

Happy coding,
